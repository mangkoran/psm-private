\chapter*{ACKNOWLEDGEMENT}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{ACKNOWLEDGEMENT}

In the name of Allah, the Almighty, the Most Gracious and the Most Merciful whom with His willing I
was able to complete the first part of the Final Year Project. I wish to express my heartiest
gratitude and indebtedness to Dr. Shukor bin Abd. Razak and Dr. Fo'ad bin Rohani for their guidance,
supervision and moral support he has given to me along the entire period of this work. Their
initiatives, encouragement and valuable suggestions are gratefully acknowledged without which this
work would not be possible.

I am also indebted to Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) for all of the facilities provided, be it
in the colleges as well as in the libraries where I am able to use the internet in order to find the
relevant literatures for my study.

Besides, I would like to thank both of my beloved parents for giving me a great moral support for me
to have courage and determination in order to complete the first part of the project successfully.

Last but not least, I would like to thank my fellow friends who had always been together with me
through my ups and downs. Their views and tips are useful indeed. Unfortunately, it is not possible
to list all of them in this limited space
